# Task Tracker

In this particular project, the administrator is responsible for delegating a specific task to an individual assignee. The necessary fields for each task assignment consist of a title, description, designated team, level of priority, and the name of the assignee. The user has the capability to include new tasks, make updates to existing tasks, and remove tasks as needed. However, it is important to note that only the priority and status fields can be modified. The status of a task can fall under various categories such as pending, in progress, completed, deployed, or deferred. Tasks that have been marked as completed are not eligible for deletion. Additionally, filtering options are available based on the assignee's name, priority level, and the date the task was created. The development of this project involves the utilization of React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Express for the backend, and MongoDB for the database management.
